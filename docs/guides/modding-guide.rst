DFHack modding guide
====================

.. highlight:: lua

What is the difference between a script and a mod?
--------------------------------------------------

Well, sometimes there is no difference. A mod is anything you add to the game,
which can be graphics overrides, content in the raws, DFHack scripts, or all of
the above. There are already resources out there for
`raws modding <https://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Modding>`__, so this
guide will focus more on scripts, both standalone and as an extension to
raws-based mods.

A DFHack script is a Lua file that can be run as a command in
DFHack. Scripts can do pretty much anything, from displaying information to
enforcing new game mechanics. If you don't already know Lua, there's a great
primer at `lua.org <https://www.lua.org/pil/contents.html>`__.

Why not just mod the raws?
--------------------------

It depends on what you want to do. Some mods *are* better to do in just the
raws. You don't need DFHack to add a new race or modify attributes. However,
DFHack scripts can do many things that you just can't do in the raws, like make
a creature that trails smoke or launch a unit into the air when they are hit
with a certain type of projectile. Some things *could* be done in the raws, but
a script is better (e.g. easier to maintain, easier to extend, and/or not prone
to side-effects). A great example is adding a syndrome when a reaction
is performed. If done in the raws, you have to create an exploding boulder as
an intermediary to apply the syndrome. DFHack scripts can add the syndrome
directly and with much more flexibility. In the end, complex mods will likely
require a mix of raw modding and DFHack scripting.

The structure of a mod
----------------------

In the example below, we'll use a mod name of ``example-mod``. I'm sure your
mods will have more creative names! Mods have a basic structure that looks like
this::

    info.txt
    graphics/...
    objects/...
    blueprints/...
    scripts_modactive/example-mod.lua
    scripts_modactive/internal/example-mod/...
    scripts_modinstalled/...
    README.md (optional)

Let's go through that line by line.

- The :file:`info.txt` file contains metadata about your mod that DF will
    display in-game. You can read more about this file in the
    `Official DF Modding Guide <https://bay12games.com/dwarves/modding_guide.html>`__.
    It would be a good idea to give your mod a ``dfhack`` tag so players can
    indentify it as requiring DFHack when they subscribe to it on the DF Steam
    workshop.
- Modifications to the game raws (potentially with
    `custom raw tokens <custom-raw-tokens>`) go in the :file:`graphics/` and
    :file:`objects/` folders. You can read more about the files that go in
    these directories on the :wiki:`Modding` wiki page.
- Any `quickfort` blueprints included with your mod go in the
    :file:`blueprints` folder. Note that your mod can *just* be blueprints and
    the :file:`info.txt` file if you like. See the next section for an example.
- A control script in :file:`scripts_modactive/` directory that handles
    system-level event hooks (e.g. reloading state when a world is loaded),
    registering `overlays <overlay-dev-guide>`, and
    `enabling/disabling <script-enable-api>` your mod. You can put other
    scripts in this directory as well if you want them to appear as runnable
    DFHack commands when your mod is active for the current world. Lua modules
    that your main scripts use, but which don't need to be directly runnable by
    the player, should go in a subdirectory under
    :file:`scripts_modactive/internal/` so they don't show up in the DFHack
    `launcher <gui/launcher>` command autocomplete lists.
- Scripts that you want to be available before a world is loaded (i.e. on the
    DF title screen) or that you want to be runnable in any world, regardless
    of whether your mod is active, should go in the
    :file:`scripts_modinstalled/` folder. You can also have an :file:`internal/`
    subfolder in here for private modules if you like.
- Finally, a :file:`README.md` file that has more information about your mod.
    If you develop your mod using version control (recommended!), that
    :file:`README.md` file can also serve as your git repository documentation.

These files end up in a subdirectory under :file:`mods/` when players copy them
in or install them from the
`Steam Workshop <https://steamcommunity.com/app/975370/workshop/>`__, and in
:file:`data/installed_mods/` when the mod is selected as "active" for the first
time.

DFHack will discover scripts in your mod's ``scripts_modinstalled/`` directory
and other DFHack-relevant data files (like blueprints) regardless of whether
the mod has been marked "active" for any player world.

What if I just want to distribute quickfort blueprints?
-------------------------------------------------------

For this, all you need is :file:`info.txt` and your blueprints.

.. highlight:: none

Your :file:`info.txt` could look something like this::

    [ID:drooble_blueprints]
    [NUMERIC_VERSION:1]
    [DISPLAYED_VERSION:1.0.0]
    [EARLIEST_COMPATIBLE_NUMERIC_VERSION:1]
    [EARLIEST_COMPATIBLE_DISPLAYED_VERSION:1.0.0]
    [AUTHOR:Drooble]
    [NAME:Drooble's blueprints]
    [DESCRIPTION:Useful quickfort blueprints for any occasion.]
    [STEAM_TITLE:Drooble's blueprints]
    [STEAM_DESCRIPTION:Useful quickfort blueprints for any occasion.]
    [STEAM_TAG:dfhack]
    [STEAM_TAG:quickfort]
    [STEAM_TAG:blueprints]

and your blueprints, which could be .csv or .xlsx files, would go in the
``blueprints/`` subdirectory. If you add blueprint file named
``blueprints/bedrooms.csv``, then it will be shown to players as
``drooble_blueprints/bedrooms.csv`` in `quickfort` and `gui/quickfort`. The
"drooble_blueprints" prefix comes from the mod ID specified in ``info.txt``.

What if I just want to distribute a simple standalone script?
-------------------------------------------------------------

If your mod is just a script with no raws modifications, all you need is::

    info.txt
    scripts_modinstalled/yourscript.lua
    README.md (optional)

Adding your script to the :file:`scripts_modinstalled/` folder will allow
DFHack to find it and add your mod to the `script-paths`. Your script will be
runnable from the title screen and in any loaded world, regardless of whether
your mod is explicitly "active".

A mod-maker's development environment
-------------------------------------

Create a folder for development somewhere outside your Dwarf Fortress
installation directory (e.g. ``/path/to/mymods/``). If you work on multiple
mods, you might want to make a subdirectory for each mod.

If you have changes to the raws, you'll still have to copy them into DF's
``data/installed_mods/`` folder to have them take effect, but you can set
things up so that scripts are run directly from your dev directory. You can
edit your scripts in your dev directory and have the changes available in the
game immediately: no copying, no restarting.

How does this magic work? Just add a line like this to your
``dfhack-config/script-paths.txt`` file::

    +/path/to/mymods/example-mod/scripts_modinstalled

Then that directory will be searched when you run DFHack commands from inside
the game. The ``+`` at the front of the path means to search that directory
first, before any other script directory (like :file:`hack/scripts` or other
versions of your mod in the DF mod folders).

The structure of the game
-------------------------

"The game", that is, all the Dwarf Fortress state, is in the global variable
`df <lua-df>`. Most of the information relevant to a script is found in
``df.global.world``, which contains data like the lists of active items and
units, whether to reindex pathfinding, et cetera. Also relevant to us are the
various data types found in the game, e.g. ``df.pronoun_type`` which we will be
using in this guide. We'll explore more of the game structures below.

Your first script
-----------------

So! It's time to write your first script. This section will walk you through how
to make a script that will get the pronoun type of the currently selected unit.
If you're not familiar with Lua script syntax, maybe skim through some topics
in the `manual <https://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/manual.html>`__ first.

.. highlight:: lua

First line, we get a reference to an in-game unit::

    local unit = dfhack.gui.getSelectedUnit()

If no unit is selected by the player in the DF UI, ``unit`` will be ``nil`` and
an error message will be printed.

If ``unit`` is ``nil``, we don't want the script to run anymore::

    if not unit then
        return
    end

Now, the field ``unit.sex`` is an integer, but each integer corresponds to a
string value ("it", "she", or "he"). We get this value by indexing the
bidirectional map ``df.pronoun_type``. Indexing the other way, with one of the
strings, will yield its corresponding number. So::

    local pronounTypeString = df.pronoun_type[unit.sex]
    print(pronounTypeString)

Simple. The entire script altogether looks like this::

    local unit = dfhack.gui.getSelectedUnit()
    if not unit then
        return
    end
    local pronounTypeString = df.pronoun_type[unit.sex]
    print(pronounTypeString)

Save the text as a ``.lua`` file in your own scripts directory and run it from
`gui/launcher` when a unit is selected in the Dwarf Fortress UI.

DFHack provides a vast library of functionality that make it easier to interact
with the game state. When you start asking yourself "How do I get/do X", search
through the `lua-api` for relevant functions and look through existing scripts
for examples.

Exploring DF state
------------------

So how could you have known about the field and type we just used? Well, there
are two main tools for discovering the various fields in the game's data
structures. The first is the ``df-structures``
`repository <https://github.com/DFHack/df-structures>`__ that contains XML files
describing the layouts of the game's structures. These are complete, but
difficult to read (for a human). The second option is the `gui/gm-editor`
interface, an interactive data explorer. You can run the script while objects
like units are selected to view the data within them. Press :kbd:`?` while the
script is active to view help.

Familiarising yourself with the many structs of the game will help with ideas
immensely, and you can always ask for help in the `right places <support>`.

Reading and writing files and other persistent state
----------------------------------------------------

There are several locations and APIs that a mod might need to read or store
data:

Global state that is not world-specific should be stored in the directory
returned by the ``scriptmanager.getModStatePath()`` function. JSON is a
convenient format for this kind of stored state, and DFHack provides facilities
for reading and writing JSON data. For example::

    local json = require('json')
    local scriptmanager = require('script-manager')
    local path = scriptmanager.getModStatePath('mymodname')
    config = config or json.open(path .. 'settings.json')

    -- modify state in the config.data table and persist it when it changes with
    -- config:write()

State that should be saved with a world or a specific fort within that world
should use `persistent-api` API. You can attach a state change hook for new
world loaded where you can load the state, which often includes whether the mod
itself is enabled (if the mod can be dynamically enabled/disabled -- see the
`script-enable-api` for more details). For example::

    --@ enable=true
    --@ module=true

    local utils = require('utils')

    local GLOBAL_KEY = 'mymodname'

    local function get_default_state()
        return {
            enabled=false,
            somevar=0,
            somesubtable={
                someothervar=0,
            },
        }
    end
    state = state or get_default_state()

    -- implement the enabled API so DFHack can read this script's status
    function isEnabled()
        return state.enabled
    end

    local function persist_state()
        dfhack.persistent.saveSiteData(GLOBAL_KEY, state)
    end

    local function do_enable()
        -- initialization tasks, such as hooking events
    end

    local function do_disable()
        -- cleanup tasks, such as removing event hooks
    end

    dfhack.onStateChange[GLOBAL_KEY] = function(sc)
        if sc == SC_MAP_UNLOADED then
            do_disable()

            -- ensure our mod doesn't run when a different
            -- world is loaded where we are *not* active
            dfhack.onStateChange[GLOBAL_KEY] = nil

            return
        end

        if sc ~= SC_MAP_LOADED or not dfhack.world.isFortressMode() then
            return
        end

        -- retrieve state saved in game. merge with default state so config
        -- saved from previous versions can pick up newer defaults.
        state = get_default_state()
        utils.assign(state, dfhack.persistent.getSiteData(GLOBAL_KEY, state))
        if state.enabled then
            do_enable()
        end
    end

Finally, you may have distributed data files with your mod that you need to
read at runtime. Your mod directory should be treated as read-only since data
there is not backed up. Use the `script-manager` API to get the path to your
mod data and the ``json`` (or any other file I/O) API as needed. For example::

    local scriptmanager = require('script-manager')

    local GLOBAL_KEY = 'mymodname'

    local function read_bulk_data_db()
        local mod_source_path = scriptmanager.getModSourcePath(GLOBAL_KEY)
        -- read data from files in the mod directory
        return ...
    end

    bulk_data_db = bulk_data_db or read_bulk_data_db()

If you want to store state in the savegame so that it is associated with the
current world/fort/adventure, use the `persistent-api` API.  or in the fuller example later in this
guide.

Reacting to events
------------------

The common method for injecting new behaviour into the game is to define a
callback function and get it called when something interesting happens. DFHack
provides two libraries for this, ``repeat-util`` and `eventful <eventful-api>`.
``repeat-util`` is used to run a function once per a configurable number of
frames (paused or unpaused), ticks (unpaused), in-game days, months, or years.
If you need to be aware the instant something happens, you'll need to run a
check once a tick. Be careful not to do this gratuitously, though, since
running callbacks too often can significantly slow down the game!

``eventful``, on the other hand, is much more performance-friendly since it will
only call your callback when a relevant event happens, like a reaction
occuring, a job being completed, or a projectile moving to a new tile.

To get something to run once every 1000 ticks, we can call
``repeat-util.scheduleEvery()``. First, we load the module::

    local repeatUtil = require('repeat-util')

Both ``repeat-util`` and ``eventful`` require keys for registered callbacks. You
should use something unique, like your mod id::

    local GLOBAL_KEY = 'mymodname'

Then, we pass the key, amount of time units between function calls, what the
time units are, and finally the callback function itself::

    repeatUtil.scheduleEvery(GLOBAL_KEY, 1000, 'ticks', function()
        -- Do something like iterating over all active units and
        -- check for something interesting
        for _, unit in ipairs(df.global.world.units.active) do
            ...
        end
    end)

``eventful`` is slightly more involved. First get the module::

    local eventful = require('plugins.eventful')

``eventful`` contains a table for each event which you populate with functions.
Each function in the table is then called with the appropriate arguments when
the event occurs. So, for example, to print the position of a moving (item)
projectile::

    eventful.onProjItemCheckMovement[GLOBAL_KEY] = function(projectile)
        print(projectile.cur_pos.x, projectile.cur_pos.y,
              projectile.cur_pos.z)
    end

Check out the `full list of supported events <eventful-api>` to see what else
you can react to with ``eventful``.

Now, you may have noticed that you won't be able to register multiple callbacks
with a single key named after your mod. You can, of course, call all the
functions you want from a single registered callback. Alternately, you can
create multiple callbacks using different keys, using your mod ID as a key name
prefix. If you do register multiple callbacks, though, there are no guarantees
about the call order.

Custom raw tokens
-----------------

.. highlight:: none

In this section, we are going to use `custom raw tokens <custom-raw-tokens>`
applied to a reaction to transfer the material of a reagent to a product as a
handle improvement (like on artifact buckets). As a second example, we are
going to make boots that make units go faster when worn.

First, let's define raws for a custom crossbow with its own custom reaction. The
crossbow::

    [ITEM_WEAPON:ITEM_WEAPON_CROSSBOW_SIEGE]
        [NAME:crossbow:crossbows]
        [SIZE:600]
        [SKILL:HAMMER]
        [RANGED:CROSSBOW:BOLT]
        [SHOOT_FORCE:4000]
        [SHOOT_MAXVEL:800]
        [TWO_HANDED:0]
        [MINIMUM_SIZE:17500]
        [MATERIAL_SIZE:4]
        [ATTACK:BLUNT:10000:4000:bash:bashes:NO_SUB:1250]
            [ATTACK_PREPARE_AND_RECOVER:3:3]
        [SIEGE_CROSSBOW_MOD_FIRE_RATE_MULTIPLIER:2] custom token (you'll see)

The reaction to make it (you would add the reaction and not the weapon to an
entity raw)::

    [REACTION:MAKE_SIEGE_CROSSBOW]
        [NAME:make siege crossbow]
        [BUILDING:BOWYER:NONE]
        [SKILL:BOWYER]
        [REAGENT:mechanism 1:2:TRAPPARTS:NONE:NONE:NONE]
        [REAGENT:bar:150:BAR:NONE:NONE:NONE]
            [METAL_ITEM_MATERIAL]
        [REAGENT:handle 1:1:BLOCKS:NONE:NONE:NONE] wooden handles
            [ANY_PLANT_MATERIAL]
        [REAGENT:handle 2:1:BLOCKS:NONE:NONE:NONE]
            [ANY_PLANT_MATERIAL]
        [SIEGE_CROSSBOW_MOD_TRANSFER_HANDLE_MATERIAL_TO_PRODUCT_IMPROVEMENT:1]
            another custom token
        [PRODUCT:100:1:WEAPON:ITEM_WEAPON_CROSSBOW_SIEGE:GET_MATERIAL_FROM_REAGENT:bar:NONE]

So, we are going to use the ``eventful`` module to react when this crossbow is
crafted, allowing us to inject the logic that will add the handle improvement.

.. highlight:: lua

First, require the modules we are going to use::

    local eventful = require('plugins.eventful')
    local customRawTokens = require('custom-raw-tokens')

and attach a callback to the event::

    local GLOBAL_KEY = 'mymodname'

    local function reaction_handler(reaction, reactionProduct, unit,
            inputItems, inputReagents, outputItems)
        -- we'll be defining the body of this function below
    end

    eventful.onReactionComplete[GLOBAL_KEY] = reaction_handler

Now let's look at the ``reaction_handler`` function and give it some logic.
First, we check to see if it the reaction that just happened is relevant to this
callback::

    if not customRawTokens.getToken(reaction,
        'SIEGE_CROSSBOW_MOD_TRANSFER_HANDLE_MATERIAL_TO_PRODUCT_IMPROVEMENT')
    then
        return
    end

Then, we check the reagents for names that start with "handle". For those
reagents, we get the corresponding item and add a handle improvement::

    for i, reagent in ipairs(inputReagents) do
        if reagent.code:startswith('handle') then
            -- Found handle reagent
            local item = inputItems[i]
            local improv = df.itemimprovement_itemspecificst:new()
            improv.mat_type, improv.mat_index = item.mat_type, item.mat_index
            improv.type = df.itemimprovement_specific_type.HANDLE
            outputItems[1].improvements:insert('#', improv)
        end
    end

Let's also modify the fire rate of our siege crossbow according to the custom
token we added to the item definition in the raws::

    eventful.onProjItemCheckMovement[GLOBAL_KEY] = function(projectile)
        if projectile.distance_flown > 0 then
            -- don't make this adjustment more than once
            return
        end

        local firer = projectile.firer
        if not firer then
            return
        end

        local weapon = df.item.find(projectile.bow_id)
        if not weapon then
            return
        end

        local multiplier = tonumber(customRawTokens.getToken(
                weapon.subtype,
                'SIEGE_CROSSBOW_MOD_FIRE_RATE_MULTIPLIER')) or 1
        firer.counters.think_counter = math.floor(
                firer.counters.think_counter * multiplier)
    end

.. highlight:: none

Now, let's see how we could make some "pegasus boots". First, let's define the
item in the raws::

    [ITEM_SHOES:ITEM_SHOES_BOOTS_PEGASUS]
        [NAME:pegasus boot:pegasus boots]
        [ARMORLEVEL:1]
        [UPSTEP:1]
        [METAL_ARMOR_LEVELS]
        [LAYER:OVER]
        [COVERAGE:100]
        [LAYER_SIZE:25]
        [LAYER_PERMIT:15]
        [MATERIAL_SIZE:2]
        [METAL]
        [LEATHER]
        [HARD]
        [PEGASUS_BOOTS_MOD_FOOT_MOVEMENT_TIMER_REDUCTION_PER_TICK:2] custom raw token
            (you don't have to comment the custom token every time,
            but it does clarify what it is)

.. highlight:: lua

Then, let's define a function that will implement the logic associated with the
boots::

    local function do_pegasus()
        for _,unit in ipairs(df.global.world.units.active) do
            local amount = 0
            for _,inv_entry in ipairs(unit.inventory) do
                if inv_entry.mode == df.unit_inventory_item.T_mode.Worn then
                    local reduction = customRawTokens.getToken(
                            inv_entry.item,
                            'PEGASUS_BOOTS_MOD_FOOT_MOVEMENT_TIMER_REDUCTION_PER_TICK')
                    amount = amount + (tonumber(reduction) or 0)
                end
            end
            -- Subtract amount from on-foot movement timers if not on ground
            if not unit.flags1.on_ground then
                dfhack.units.subtractActionTimers(unit, amount,
                        df.unit_action_type_group.MovementFeet)
            end
        end
    end

Finally, we can schedule the callback to be run once a tick using the
``repeat-util`` module::

    repeatUtil.scheduleEvery(GLOBAL_KEY, 1, 'ticks', do_pegasus)

Note that the ``do_pegasus`` function as written here is **extremely
inefficient**. In a real mod, you would likely want to cache which units are
equipping pegasus boots so you don't have to scan every inventory item of every
active unit on every tick.

Putting it all together
-----------------------

Ok, you're all set up! Now, let's take a look at an example
``scripts_modinstalled/example-mod.lua`` file::

    -- main file for the example-mod mod

    -- these lines indicate that the script supports the "enable"
    -- API so you can start it by running "enable example-mod" and
    -- stop it by running "disable example-mod"
    --@ module=true
    --@ enable=true

The ``scripts_modinstalled/internal/example-mod/module-a.lua`` file could look
something like this::

    --@ module=true

    -- global (non-local) variables and functions are exported
    function onEnable()
        -- ...
    end

    function onDisable()
        -- ...
    end

    -- this is a local function: local functions/variables
    -- are not accessible to other scripts.
    local function usedByCycle(unit)
        -- ...
    end

    function cycle() -- exported
        for _,unit in ipairs(df.global.world.units.active) do
            usedByCycle(unit)
        end
    end

The `reqscript <reqscript>` function reloads scripts that have changed, so you
can modify your scripts while DF is running and just disable/enable your mod to
load the changes into your running game!
