.. dfhack-command:: autodump-destroy-here
    :summary: Destroy items marked for dumping under the keyboard cursor.

This tool can instantly move all unforbidden items marked for dumping to the
tile under the keyboard cursor. After moving the items, the dump flag is unset
and the forbid flag is set, just as if it had been dumped normally. See
``gui/autodump`` for an interactive version of this tool.

The keyboard cursor can be placed on a floor tile or in the air. If in air,
the items will be converted into projectiles and fall. Items cannot be dumped
inside of walls.
